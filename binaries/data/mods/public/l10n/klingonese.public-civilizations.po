"Kunobelinos (perhaps better known by the latinized form of Cunobelin) was a "
"powerful ruler of the Catuvellauni. He was referred to by Romans as the King"
" of the Britons. His domains extended around the city of Kamulodunon (known "
"as Camulodunum), modern day Colchester. The Roman defeat in the battle of "
"Teutoburg Forest (Germania) allowed Kunobelinos to conquer a neighboring "
"tribe, the Trinovantes, who were Roman allies and couldn't receive Roman "
"aid. Kunobelinos seems to have been indifferent to the Romans. He traded "
"with them freely, but had few qualms subjugating known Roman allies, and "
"even sent his youngest son Adminius as a fosterling to be educated in Roman "
"Gaul. This accounted for Adminius's friendships among the Romans. Adminius "
"was given lordship over the Cantaci, who inhabited Kent, by his father. This"
" area was the prime area of Roman influence and trade in Britain, and "
"Kunobelinos shrewdly observed his youngest son's friendship with powerful "
"Roman and Gallo-Roman politicians and traders would be of use administrating"
" the region. His other sons though had no love for the Romans. When "
"Kunobelinos died of disease, he was replaced by his son Togdumnos, who "
"arrested, executed, or expelled numerous Roman sympathizers. These included "
"his own brother Adminius, and the deposed Atrebates king, Verica, who "
"appealed to their connections in the Roman Empire for aide in recovering "
"their lands. Togdumnos died in battle with the Romans, and was subsequently "
"replaced by his brother, Karatakos. It is an irony that it was his third son"
" that initially invited this Roman reprisal. Kunobelinos in his own time "
"though was possibly one of the greatest of all British kings. He conquered "
"the great majority of the southern half of Britain (his coins were being "
"minted as far as the borders of what would become Wales). He started ruling "
"over only four minor tribes in a confederation, the Catuvellauni, and ended "
"up achieving recognition as king of Britain. This recognition was so great "
"that tribes in Cambria even came to assist his sons against the Romans and "
"their British allies, and Kunobelinos was held up by the post-Roman Britons "
"as one of their great heroes; a conqueror and uniter of petty kingdoms, "
"something the post-Roman Britons or Romano-British sorely needed."

"Ammianus Marcellinus described how difficult it would be for a band of "

" was stronger than he was and could rain blows and kicks upon the assailants"
" equal in force to the shots of a catapult. Boudicca, queen of the Iceni, "
"was said to be 'very tall and terrifying in appearance; her voice was very "
"harsh and a great mass of red hair fell over her shoulders. She wore a tunic"
" of many colors over which a thick cloak was fastened by a brooch. Boudicca "
"had actually at first been a Roman ally, along with her husband, Prasutagus,"
" king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had been a close Roman ally after a brief "

"dictated, except in one case. Prasutagus, realizing he was going to die, "

"inherit the physical running of the territory, under Boudicca's stewardship "
"until they were adults, and the Emperor of Rome would have overlordship, "
"collecting taxes and being allowed to request military aid. Much the same "
"situation as he already held. The problem lay in that the Romans did not "

"noted it was regular Roman practice to only allow a client kingdom to be "
"independent for the lifetime of the initial king, such as had occurred in "
"Galatia. The Empire formally annexed the kingdom, and began extracting harsh"
" taxes immediately, citing that Prasutagus was indebted to the Romans, "
"having taken several loans during his lifetime that he had failed to repay. "

"Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous leader of "
"the Gauls who took Rome in the time of Camillus. According to Geoffrey of "
"Monmouth, the cleric who wrote “History of the Kings of Britain”, Brennus "
"and his brother Belinus invaded Gaul and sacked Rome in 390 B.C., 'proving' "
"that Britons had conquered Rome, the greatest civilization in the world, "
"long before Rome conquered the Britons. We know from many ancient sources "
"which predate Geoffrey that Rome was indeed sacked, but in 387 not 390, and "
"that the raid was led by a man named Brennus, but he and his invading horde "

"Geoffrey's editing method can be seen: he modified the historical Brennus, "
"created the brother Belinus, borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the "
"parts where the Celts seemed weak or foolish. His technique is both additive"
" and subtractive. Like the tale of Trojan origin, the story of the sack of "
"Rome is not pure fabrication; it is a creative rearrangement of the "
"available facts, with details added as necessary. By virtue of their "
"historical association, Beli and Bran are often muddled with the earlier "
